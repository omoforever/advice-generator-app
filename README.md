# Advice Generator App

A simple and responsive quote generator built as part of a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. This project fetches random advice from an external API and displays it within a styled card UI.

## Overview

This app includes:

- A centered advice card with dynamic content
- A button with hover effects that triggers new advice
- Responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop screens
- Fetching advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)

The goal was to focus on **API integration**, **dynamic DOM updates**, and **responsive component design**.

## Built With

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Fetch API)

## What I Learned

- Styling for dynamic and responsive content cards  
- Implementing accessible hover and click states for interactive UI elements
